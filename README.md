Anki addons

The Anki addons documentated here were produced for my own use, but as I have benefited from using the work others have shared I have shared these as well.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://r-appleton.github.io/contents.html)
 
I hope that these addons are also useful for you.
 
If you find an error please include as much information as possible, including any stack trace, when reporting it.
