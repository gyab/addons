<title>Anki Script example course using custom syntax</title>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>

<body>
    This addin provides a simple illustration of using Anki Script to deliver a course to students that progressively builds up the type of knowledge that 
    students should learn, as well as data to be learned.
    <p>
    The intention is that course providers can ensure that students have Anki correctly configured, and are not presented with knowledge ahead of their level,
    ie. they should not be presented with fields and cards for features that they have not yet encountered in the course.
    <p>
    In this demonstration the addin is installed with a simple card setup for learning Russian verbs in their infinitive form.  The lessons develop the model 
    and data to learn as follows:
    <ul>
        <li> lesson 1 - adds verb infinitives to learn
        <li> lesson 2 - adds present tense declension to the model, and adds some more verbs.  Declensions are also populated for verbs from lesson 1.
        <li> lesson 3 - adds past tense declension to the model, and adds some more verbs.  Declensions are also populated for verbs from lessons 1 and 2.
        <li> lesson 4 - adds the concept of verb aspects, including installing an adding to help learn aspect pairs
    </ul>
